### Lending-Case

This project explores the rise and evolution of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms, such as LendingClub, Prosper, and Kiva. 
These fintech platforms leverage technology and data analytics to connect borrowers and investors, offering a low-cost
alternative to traditional banking. With rapid growth over the past decade—38% of personal loans in the U.S. were issued through fintechs 
by 2018—the industry has evolved to include institutional investors and digital banking services. A key milestone includes LendingClub's 
2021 acquisition  of Radius Bank, transitioning the company from a P2P platform to a full-spectrum fintech marketplace bank, 
signaling a major shift in the online lending ecosystem.
